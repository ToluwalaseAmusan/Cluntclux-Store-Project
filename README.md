## 🗄 SQL Analysis

This project also includes an *SQL script* (SQL/retail_sales_analysis.sql) used to analyze the dataset.  
It covers key business questions such as:  

- ✅ Total sales amount & number of orders  
- ✅ Total sales by product category  
- ✅ Monthly sales trends (year-wise)  
- ✅ Orders breakdown by shipping state  
- ✅ Average order amount by sales channel  
- ✅ Top 5 cities with highest sales  
- ✅ Customer-based purchase trends (by gender & age category)  
- ✅ B2B vs B2C sales performance  
- ✅ Return rate by product category  

These queries demonstrate my ability to *extract insights directly from raw data* before visualization in Power BI.

1. Download the cleaned dataset from the Data folder.  
2. Run SQL scripts from the SQL folder to reproduce KPIs.  
3. Open sales_dashboard.pbix in Power BI to explore the dashboard interactively.
